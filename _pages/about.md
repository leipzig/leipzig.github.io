full_bio: |
  I am an accomplished bioinformatics leader with over 25 years of experience spanning academic research, startup environments, and product management. My career has been dedicated to developing bioinformatics tools and platforms that enable researchers to visualize, explore, and publish their data effectively.

  Throughout my career, I have helped four diagnostic, therapeutic, and SaaS startups define their bioinformatic product strategy, successfully bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and practical commercial applications. My expertise encompasses the full spectrum of bioinformatics, from low-level algorithm development to high-level product strategy and customer engagement.

  As a researcher, I have authored over 50 publications with an h-index of 30, contributing significantly to fields including HIV integration site analysis, mitochondrial genetics, reproducible research methodologies, and computational pipeline development. My work has been published in prestigious journals including Cell, Nature, PLoS Computational Biology, and Genome Research.

  I am passionate about community building and knowledge sharing, having founded the PhillyR user group and maintaining a top-20 ranking on biostars.org. My commitment to open science and reproducible research has led to the development of multiple open-source tools and frameworks that are widely used in the bioinformatics community.

  Currently serving as Product Manager at TileDB, I manage the population genomics product line, working directly with biopharma and hospital partners to develop scalable analysis workflows. My unique combination of deep technical expertise, research experience, and business acumen allows me to effectively translate complex computational challenges into successful product solutions.

My career has dealt primarily with writing software to visualize, explore, and manipulate biological data. I have worked as a bioinformatics software engineer and product manager - in academia, industry, and in diagnostic, therapeutic and platform startups. During my roles in product development I have helped software companies understand and navigate the bioinformatics space. I have over 40 peer-reviewed publications, and an O'Reilly book. My university training was in Biology and Computer Science with an emphasis on bioinformatics and statistical genetics, and a PhD in information science with a dissertation on reproducible research.

With over 25 years of experience spanning academia and industry, I bring a unique perspective that combines deep technical expertise with product management and business strategy. My work encompasses everything from fundamental algorithm development to scaling production systems for enterprise clients.
