## Educational Philosophy

My teaching approach focuses on bridging the gap between computational methods and biological research. Through my experience at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and Drexel University, I emphasize practical, hands-on learning that enables researchers to apply computational tools effectively in their work.

I believe in making complex bioinformatics concepts accessible through:
- Real-world examples and case studies
- Interactive programming exercises
- Community engagement and knowledge sharing
- Open science and reproducible research practices

This philosophy extends to my community work with PhillyR and my contributions to online forums, where I've helped thousands of researchers solve computational challenges in their work.
